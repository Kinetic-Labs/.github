# Kinetic Labs

Kinetic Labs provides alternative, lighter weight solutions to other tools in the world.

## Our projects
- LogThing: Process, aggregate, store and view logs without the hassle
- TraceThing: Painless Java profilign with minimal performance overhead
- LoadThing: High-performance reverse-proxy with an abundance of features and plenty of monitoring to go along
- DocThing: Generate docs from a Markdown file or code comments for any project
- NixThing: A high-performance Nix parser, evaluator and AST library for Java

## Used languages
For the curious-or nerdy-here are the programming languages we use:
- [Java](https://java.com): It's performant and easy to prototype in.
- [Kotlin](https://kotl.in): Very fun and a great addition to projects that handle data processing or need unspaghettification (or is it despaghettification?).
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org): Fun, performant, safe and typed, great for low-level or projects needing a performance boost.
- [Haskell](https://haskell.org): It is, infact, and esoteric language, but it's a good one and when it comes to parsing, type safety or being lazy, it's a pretty solid choice.
    - Bonus points for nix support with [Stack](https://haskellstack.org)
    - 1000000000000 Bonus points for being purple on GitHub
    - Bonus points for having a good LSP
    - Bonus points for being functional
- [C](https://www.c-language.org): Simple and fast
- [C++](https://isocpp.org): I enjoy OOP and C++ has some cool safety features

## Used tools
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/): The only build system you should be using for Java
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): The only build system you should actually use for Java lol both are good
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/): A great build system for C/C++, it lets you create a project with minimal configuration and hit the ground running faster than any build system i've ever used.
- [Autotools/Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/): Feels both lightweight and powerful
- [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable): Haskell build system thats almost tolerable
- Please just use cargo for rust unless you really need to use something else

That has been my Ted talk
