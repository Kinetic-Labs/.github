# Kinetic Labs

Kinetic Labs provides alternative, lighter weight solutions to other tools in the world.

## Our projects
- LogThing: Process, aggregate, store and view logs without the hassle
- TraceThing: Painless Java profilign with minimal performance overhead
- LoadThing: High-performance reverse-proxy with an abundance of features and plenty of monitoring to go along
- DocThing: Generate docs from a Markdown file or code comments for any project

## Used languages
For the curious-or nerdy-here are the programming languages we use:
- [Java](https://java.com): It's performant and easy to prototype in.
- [Kotlin](https://kotl.in): Very fun and a great addition to projects that handle data processing or need unspaghettification (or is it despaghettification?).
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org): Fun, performant, safe and typed, great for low-level or projects needing a performance boost.
- [Haskell](https://haskell.org): It is, infact, and esoteric language, but it's a good one and when it comes to parsing, type safety or being lazy, it's a pretty solid choice.
    - Bonus points for nix support with [Stack](https://haskellstack.org)
    - Bonus points for being purple on GitHub
    - Bonus points for having a good LSP
    - Bonus points for being functional
